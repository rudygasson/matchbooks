# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# puts "Add 5 Users..."

# 5.times do
#   user = Faker::Internet.user('username', 'email')
#   user.password = "123456"
#   User.create!(user)
# end

# puts "Add 5 Locations in 2 districts..."

# 5.times do
#   location = Location.new(
#     name: Faker::Restaurant.name,
